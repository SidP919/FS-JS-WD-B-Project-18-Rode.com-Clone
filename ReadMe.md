## What I have learnt while making this project?

> *Not only I have gotten more comfortable using Tailwind CSS classes and referring to its documentation, but with this project, I have also gotten more familiar and comfortable with using Tailwind component libraries' code and components. I also got to learn a bit about customization with Tailwind CSS, like making changes in tailwind.config to increase the priority of Tailwind CSS properties over inline styles by making **important** as **true**. I used this to change the placement of the Language drop-down menu in the Header. Hence, I can say that it was quite fruitful to work on this project.*
